## Mockup Screenshots

Below are two mockup images of the Your Weather website created using the "Am I Responsive" website.

## UX

- The design for Your Weather was created as a series of wireframes covering mobile, tablet and desktop to determine the initial design and layout of the site.
- Your Weather site was designed with ease of use and simplicity in mind.
- A simple clean look was built so that all a user needs to do is enter their town or city name and click search.

### Colour Scheme

- The chosen colour scheme for Your Weather is designed to be inviting and have a neutral aesthetic while giving a nice splash of colour.
- The colours used are as follows:-

- `#9ecffa` used for primary text.
- `#9ecffa` used for primary highlights.
- `#fafafa` used for secondary text.
- `#fafafa` used for secondary highlights.
- `#7f0ffb and #c27b6f` combined to create a linear gradient background.
- `#000` used for box shadows and modal background.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/7f0ffb-c27b6f-9ecffa-fafafa-000000) to generate my colour palette.

</details><br>

I have used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
  --display-background: linear-gradient(135deg, #7f0ffb, #c27b6f);
  --text-color: #9ecffa;
  --text-hover-color: #fafafa;
  --box-shadow-color: #000;
  --drop-shadow-color: #9ecffa;
  --modal-background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
}
```

### Typography

- I used the Google Font called 'Play' for the Your Weather site.
- I felt that this font had a nice modern style that is easy to read and that it fitted well with the Your Weather site.

- [Play](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play) was used for all text within the site.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the Your Weather site, for GitHub links in the footer and modal and for the search icon in the main weather card.
